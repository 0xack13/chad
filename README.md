Chad is a high-level, general-purpose programming language, similar to Rust, C, and JavaScript.

## Example

Below is a hello world program written in Chad:

```rust
  fn main() {
    println("Hello World!");
  }
```

The [examples](https://github.com/0xhiro/chad/tree/master/examples) directory contains more sample scripts.

## Features

* Simple Rust-like syntax
* Blazingly fast âš¡âš¡âš¡
* Light and compact, with focus on simplicity
* Built-in support for most common data types including booleans, integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and chars.
* Dynamic typing with optional static typing
* Remote code execution using URLs
* Security features such as explicit filesystem and networking permissions 
* Specify entry function to the interpreter
* Scripts can be interpreted directly
* Scripts can be compiled to binary executables (ðŸš§ pending)
* Detailed error reporting
* Standard library for networking, and frequently used utilities
* Very tiny interpreter, as small as 400KB
* Variadic functions
* External files, modules and libraries
* Chad files end with `.chad` extension
